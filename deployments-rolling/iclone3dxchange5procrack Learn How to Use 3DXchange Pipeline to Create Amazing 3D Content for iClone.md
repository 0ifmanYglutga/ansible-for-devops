## Step 1: Import Your Character into 3DXchange 5 Pro
 
The first step is to import your character into 3DXchange 5 Pro. You can do this by clicking on the Import button on the toolbar and browsing for your character file. You can import characters from Daz, Maya, 3DS Max, Mixamo, and other platforms that support FBX format.
 
Once you import your character, you will see it in the preview window. You can use the Transform & Alignment tools to rotate and resize your character with the correct scale and axis parameters. You can also use the Group tool to separate objects, edit model hierarchy, build parent-child node relations, rename objects, exclude unwanted parts, and output selected objects separately for improved animation capability later.
 
## Step 2: Convert Your Character into iClone Standard
 
The next step is to convert your character into iClone standard. This means that your character will be compatible with iClone's bone structure and facial morphs. To do this, you need to use the Characterization panel on the right side of the interface.
 
First, you need to select a preset profile that matches your character's bone structure. You can choose from Human (Standard), Human (Biped), Human (4 Spine Bones), Animal (Quadruped), or Custom. Then, you need to assign each bone of your character to the corresponding bone of the iClone standard. You can do this by dragging and dropping the bones from the source list to the target list.
 
After you finish assigning the bones, you can click on the Convert button to convert your character into iClone standard. You will see a green check mark next to each bone that has been successfully converted. If there are any errors or warnings, you can click on them to see more details and fix them.
 
## Step 3: Edit Your Character's Facial Morphs
 
The final step is to edit your character's facial morphs. This will allow you to use iClone's powerful facial animation tools such as facial puppeteering, multi-pass facial mocap, and accurate lip-sync animation.
 
To edit your character's facial morphs, you need to switch to the Expression Editor tab on the Characterization panel. Here, you will see a list of facial morphs that iClone supports. You can click on each morph to see how it affects your character's face in the preview window.
 
If your character has facial blend shapes that match iClone's facial morphs, you can simply assign them by dragging and dropping them from the source list to the target list. If your character does not have facial blend shapes or they do not match iClone's facial morphs, you can use the Edit Morph button to manually adjust each morph using sliders or mouse movements.
 
After you finish editing your character's facial morphs, you can click on the Apply button to apply them to your character. You will see a green check mark next to each morph that has been successfully applied. If there are any errors or warnings, you can click on them to see more details and fix them.
 
## Step 4: Export Your Character into iClone
 
Now that you have converted your character into iClone standard and edited its facial morphs, you are ready to export it into iClone and start animating it.
