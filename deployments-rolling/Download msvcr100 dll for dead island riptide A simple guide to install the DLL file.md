## What is msvcr100.dll?
 
msvcr100.dll is a file that belongs to Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package, which is a software library that provides runtime components for various applications and games developed with Visual C++. Some games or applications may need the file in the game/application installation folder, while others may require it in the Windows system folder. If the file is deleted, misplaced, corrupted, or incompatible, it can cause errors and prevent the program from running properly.
 
## How to fix msvcr100.dll missing error for Dead Island: Riptide?
 
There are several possible solutions to fix this error, depending on the cause and your system configuration. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Reboot your PC. Sometimes, a simple restart can clear up any conflicting installs or processes that may interfere with the game.
2. Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) from Microsoft Download Center[^1^]. This will provide the missing file and other components that the game needs. If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, you should also install the 64-bit version (x64) of the package.
3. Copy msvcr100.dll from another source. You can download the file from a reliable website like DLL-files.com[^1^], or copy it from another PC that has it. Make sure to use the 32-bit file for 32-bit software, and 64-bit file for 64-bit software. You can place the file in the game installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\diriptide), or in the Windows system folder (usually C:\Windows\System32 for 32-bit systems or C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for 64-bit systems).
4. Verify integrity of game cache on Steam. This will check and repair any corrupted or missing files for the game. To do this, right-click on Dead Island: Riptide in your Steam library, select Properties, go to Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Cache.
5. Run the game as administrator. Sometimes, the game may need elevated permissions to access certain files or folders. To do this, right-click on Dead Island: Riptide.exe in your game installation folder, select Properties, go to Compatibility tab, check Run this program as an administrator, and click OK.

Hopefully, one of these methods will fix the msvcr100.dll missing error for Dead Island: Riptide and let you play the game without any problems. If you still encounter any issues, you can contact the game developer or Microsoft support for further assistance.
