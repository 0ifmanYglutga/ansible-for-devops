Steam and gas turbines are devices that convert thermal energy into mechanical energy. They work on the principle of expanding and compressing a fluid (such as steam or air) in a series of stages. The fluid is heated by burning a fuel (such as coal, oil or natural gas) or by nuclear fission in a boiler or a reactor. The heated fluid then passes through a nozzle, where it expands and accelerates to a high velocity. The fluid then enters a turbine, where it impinges on a set of blades attached to a shaft. The force of the fluid on the blades causes the shaft to rotate, which in turn drives a generator or a compressor. The fluid then exits the turbine and is either condensed back to liquid (in case of steam) or cooled down (in case of air) and reused.
 
Steam and gas turbines have many applications in various industries, such as power generation, aviation, marine propulsion, oil and gas production, etc. They offer several advantages over other types of engines, such as high efficiency, reliability, durability, flexibility and environmental friendliness. However, they also face some challenges, such as high initial cost, maintenance requirements, noise and vibration issues, etc.
 
Steam and Gas Turbine by R Yadav PDF is a comprehensive book that covers all the aspects of steam and gas turbine engineering. It includes topics such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, combustion, materials, design, performance analysis, testing, operation and control of steam and gas turbines. It also provides numerous examples, problems, diagrams and tables to illustrate the concepts and applications of steam and gas turbines.
