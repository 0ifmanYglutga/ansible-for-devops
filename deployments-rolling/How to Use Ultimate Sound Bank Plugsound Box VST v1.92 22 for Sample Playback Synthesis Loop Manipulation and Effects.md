Kolor Autopano Giga 4.4.2 is a powerful and easy-to-use photo-editing software that can handle any kind of panorama, from simple linear ones to complex spherical ones. It can work with images from any camera, including RAW files, and it can stitch together as little as two images or as many as several thousand. It also has a range of features that can help you enhance your panoramas, such as color correction, fast editor, real-time panorama editor, mask tool, and anti-ghost algorithm.
 
In this article, we will show you how to create stunning panoramas with Kolor Autopano Giga 4.4.2 in just a few steps.
 
## Step 1: Capture your images
 
The first step is to capture your images for the panorama. You can use any camera, but it's best to shoot in portrait format to get more resolution and less lens distortion. You also need to ensure a good overlap of up to 20-30% from one image to the next, so that Autopano Giga can find matching points and align them correctly. You can shoot handheld or use a tripod with a panoramic head for more accuracy.

You can make linear panoramas (horizontal shifts only) or multi-angle panoramas (with several images in a vertical movement, in addition to the horizontal shift). You can also use a telephoto focal length to reduce lens distortions and bring objects closer, but you will need to shoot more images in these sequences.
 
## Step 2: Import your images
 
The next step is to import your images into Autopano Giga 4.4.2. You can drag and drop your files into the software or use the file browser to select them. Autopano Giga will automatically group your images into panoramas based on their EXIF data and matching points. You can also manually group or ungroup your images if you want.
 
Autopano Giga will display thumbnails of your panoramas on the left panel and a preview of the selected panorama on the right panel. You can double-click on any thumbnail to open it in the editor window.
 
## Step 3: Edit your panorama
 
The third step is to edit your panorama using the tools and options available in Autopano Giga 4.4.2. You can adjust the projection, crop, horizon, and orientation of your panorama using the buttons on the top toolbar or the sliders on the right panel. You can also use the color correction engine to balance the exposure and colors of your images automatically or manually.
 
If you have moving objects or people in your panorama, you might encounter some ghosting or blending issues. You can use the mask tool to select which parts of each image you want to keep or discard in the final panorama. You can also use the anti-ghost algorithm to detect and remove ghosting automatically.
 
## Step 4: Export your panorama
 
The final step is to export your panorama as an image file or a virtual tour. You can choose from various formats and settings depending on your needs and preferences. You can also add metadata and watermark to your panorama if you want.
 
To export your panorama as an image file, click on the "Render" button on the top toolbar or go to File > Render. You can choose from JPEG, TIFF, PNG, PSD, or EXR formats and specify the quality, size, resolution, and color space of your output file.
 
To export your panorama as a virtual tour, click on the "Create virtual tour" button on the top toolbar or go to File > Create virtual tour.
