# How to Install English Software on Pioneer Carrozzeria AVIC DRZ09
 
If you have a Pioneer Carrozzeria AVIC DRZ09 car navigation system and you want to use it in English, you might be wondering how to install the English software on it. Unfortunately, there is no official English software available for this model, as it is designed for the Japanese domestic market only. However, there are some unofficial ways to translate some of the menus and functions into English, using custom firmware or software patches. In this article, we will explain how to do that, but please note that this is not a guaranteed solution and it may void your warranty or damage your device. Proceed at your own risk.
 
## Method 1: Using a Custom Firmware
 
One way to install English software on your Pioneer Carrozzeria AVIC DRZ09 is to use a custom firmware that has been modified by some enthusiasts. This firmware replaces some of the Japanese strings with English ones, but it does not translate everything. You will still see some Japanese characters on the screen, and some functions may not work properly. Also, this firmware is based on an older version of the original software, so you may lose some features or updates.

To use this method, you will need a Windows computer, a USB flash drive, and a copy of the custom firmware file. You can download the file from [^1^], which is a GitHub repository created by Shtirlitz. The file name is PS140PLT.PRG and it is located in the RZ09 folder. You will also need a copy of the original firmware file for your device, which you can download from [^2^], which is the official Pioneer website. The file name is CNDV-70xx\_APL\_14122007.iso and it is located in the AVIC-D3 section.

5. Burn this image file to a blank CD-R using any software that can burn ISO files. Make sure you use the lowest possible speed and verify the data after burning.
6. Turn off your car engine and remove any discs from your AVIC DRZ09 device.
7. Insert the CD-R with the original firmware into your AVIC DRZ09 device.

12. When the update is finished, you will see a message saying \"Update completed\".
13. Eject the USB flash drive and restart your device.

You should now see some of the menus and functions in English on your AVIC DRZ09 device. However, as we mentioned before, this is not a complete translation and some features may not work properly. Use this method at your own risk.
 
## Method 2: Using a Software Patch
 
Another way to install English software on your Pioneer Carrozzeria AVIC DRZ09 is to use a software patch that has been created by some enthusiasts. This patch modifies some of the strings in the original data file of your device, replacing some of the Japanese characters with English ones. However, this patch does not translate everything either, and it may cause some errors or glitches on your device. Also, this patch requires some technical skills and tools to apply it correctly.
