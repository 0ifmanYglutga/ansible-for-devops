Automation Studio 5.2 is a software tool that allows you to design, simulate, and program automation systems using various technologies, such as PLCs, hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical, and renewable energy. In this article, we will focus on how to use the Library Do feature for PLC programming.
 
Library Do is a feature that enables you to create and use custom libraries of PLC components that look like real-world devices. You can choose from a variety of illustrated libraries, such as Allen Bradley, Eaton, Koyo, LS Electric, Mitsubishi, Omron, Siemens, and more[^1^]. You can also create your own libraries using the Library Editor.

Using Library Do, you can wire up the PLC components on a virtual breadboard, write the ladder logic using the integrated editor, and run the simulation to see the inputs and outputs being triggered on the PLC according to your logic. You can also monitor and modify the values of variables and registers during simulation.
 
Library Do helps you to learn PLC programming in a realistic and interactive way. You can practice with different PLC models and configurations without having to buy or install any hardware. You can also test your logic before deploying it to a real PLC device.

To use Library Do for PLC programming, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Open Automation Studio 5.2 and create a new project.
2. Select the Illustrated Libraries technology from the Project Explorer.
3. Drag and drop the PLC Custom Library component from the Component Library onto the workspace.
4. Double-click on the PLC Custom Library component to open its properties.
5. Select the desired PLC model from the drop-down list.
6. Click on the Edit button to open the Library Editor.
7. Add or remove components from the library as needed. You can use the search function to find components by name or category.
8. Save and close the Library Editor.
9. Wire up the PLC components on the breadboard using the Connection tool. You can use different colors for different types of wires.
10. Double-click on the Ladder Logic component to open the Ladder Editor.
11. Write your ladder logic using the available instructions and operands. You can use drag and drop or keyboard shortcuts to insert elements.
12. Save and close the Ladder Editor.
13. Click on the Run button to start the simulation.
14. Observe the behavior of the PLC components on the breadboard and the ladder logic on the Ladder Editor. You can use the Pause, Step, Reset, and Stop buttons to control the simulation.
15. Use the Watch Window or the Data Monitor tool to view and modify the values of variables and registers during simulation.
